# Kaggriculture

**Autonomous farming agents with domain-informed state features, economic planning,
paired simulation evaluation, and reproducible AWS experiments.**

This project studies sequential decisions in a competitive farming economy: allocating labor,
growing crops, managing livestock, expanding land, and selling into a shared nonlinear market.
The central question is which observation-safe representations improve decisions and win rates.

**Current stage: crop action-feature research.** The simulator and observation audit are
verified. The first bounded experiment evaluates four feature families through 80 paired
development games. Feature research remains open; no competitive or Kaggle score is claimed.

## Review the work

1. [00 · Simulator and evaluation contract](notebooks/00_environment.ipynb)
2. [01 · Observation audit and feature hypotheses](notebooks/01_data_audit.ipynb)
3. [02 · Crop action-feature comparisons](notebooks/02_feature_research.ipynb)
4. [Fixed experiment specification](docs/feature_experiment.md)
5. [Feature research protocol](docs/research_protocol.md)

The [first experiment findings](docs/feature_findings.md) explain the measured family effects,
the unresolved watering result, and why storage and stronger opponents come next.

The notebooks execute from saved, verified local results. The [machine-readable summary](reports/foundation.json)
and [candidate registry](reports/feature_registry.csv) identify exactly what was measured.

## Problem and metric

[Kaggriculture](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/kaggriculture) is a two-player simulation,
with a nominal 30-day, 720-state season. Final bank balance determines each game's winner;
unsold inventory does not count. Official ranking depends on wins/losses/ties, and the
competition describes a final Bradley–Terry tournament. Coin margin is a supporting diagnostic.

The pinned official engine runs **719 action rounds and records 720 states**, including the
initial state. We use its exact default horizon rather than modifying it to fit the prose guide.
Local performance against an official starter or passive agent does not estimate leaderboard rank.

## Reproduce the current milestones

Python 3.12 and [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) are required.

```bash
uv sync --frozen
PYTHONPATH=src uv run python scripts/run_foundation.py
PYTHONPATH=src uv run python scripts/run_feature_research.py
PYTHONPATH=src uv run python scripts/audit_feature_behavior.py
uv run pytest -q
uv run ruff check .
uv run ruff format --check .
PYTHONPATH=src uv run python scripts/execute_notebooks.py
```

These commands run full development seasons, reuse matching verified episode checkpoints,
recompute the observation audit, and execute the canonical notebooks. Episode configuration,
engine files, runner code, feature code, and semantic episode hashes are recorded. Corrupted
checkpoints raise an error; different lineage gets a separate experiment key.

## AWS workspace

| Setting | Configuration |
|---|---|
| Region | `us-west-2` |
| Space | `kaggriculture-dev` |
| Compute | `ml.m5.xlarge` · 4 vCPU · 16 GiB |
| Persistent volume | 30 GiB |
| Idle shutdown | 60 minutes |
| Storage | Private, encrypted, versioned S3 bucket in `configs/aws.json` |

The observed on-demand compute price was $0.23/hour on September 9, 2026, before storage and
request charges. Setup work has a 20-minute process timeout. Future experiment budgets must be
scoped before launch; a timeout or idle shutdown is not an account-wide spending cap.

## Feature research is the completion gate

The initial feature vector describes crop state, livestock state, labor and land, inventory and
storage, nonlinear sale curves, visible town demand, remaining time, and the public opponent.
It contains **candidates**, not empirically selected features. Constant or duplicate columns in
simple reference rollouts indicate missing state coverage; they are not automatically discarded.

The first action-feature experiment evaluates 13 templates for crop lifecycle value, watering
urgency, labor allocation and terminal banking in one fixed scheduler. All remain provisional.
See [paired results](reports/feature_ablations.csv) and the [research summary](reports/feature_research.json).
Market pressure, storage, livestock, fertilizer and stronger opponents remain to be studied.
Every major family needs information-availability checks, controlled additions and removals,
seed-paired uncertainty, and performance against diverse opponents.

Read [the source audit](docs/source_audit.md) for mechanics that affect the design. The full
standards are in [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md). Final optimization remains blocked by the research gate.
